### Overview

Welcome to the **DBA4811 Analytical Tools for Consulting** Project GitHub repository. This repository contains all the necessary materials and code for our analytical project focused on helping Ziro make informed decisions regarding entering the Chicago bike-sharing market. In this project, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and strategic recommendations.


### Project Background

Ziro has sought our team's expertise to evaluate the feasibility of entering the Chicago bike-sharing market. Their objective is to make data-driven decisions regarding market entry and go-to-market strategies. Specifically, they are interested in:

1. Market Overview: We provide a high-level overview of the Chicago bike-sharing market. This analysis instills confidence in Ziro by recommending a pilot test at the top 20 stations before committing to a full-scale operation. This strategy minimizes capital investment risks.

2. Pilot Test Strategy: We recommend the optimal time period for the pilot test and provide predictions for the total number of daily bike users in Chicago during this period.

3. Station-Level Analysis: Our project also focuses on in-depth analysis of the top 20 stations, helping Ziro predict the daily demand at one of these stations based on weather conditions.


### Project Structure

Our project is organized into the following key phases:

1. Data Preprocessing: We clean and prepare the raw data for analysis, ensuring its quality and integrity.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization: We explore the dataset to gain insights, visualize trends, and identify patterns that will inform our recommendations.

3. Predictive Models: We employ advanced analytics and machine learning models to predict expected demand, aiding Ziro in resource allocation and operational planning.


4. Recommendations: We provide strategic recommendations based on our findings to guide Ziro's market entry and go-to-market strategies.
