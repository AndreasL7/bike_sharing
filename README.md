Overview


Welcome to the DBA4811 Analytical Tools for Consulting Project GitHub repository. This repository contains all the necessary materials and code for our analytical project focused on helping Ziro make informed decisions regarding entering the Chicago bike-sharing market. In this project, we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling, and strategic recommendations.


Project Background
Ziro has sought our team's expertise to evaluate the feasibility of entering the Chicago bike-sharing market. Their objective is to make data-driven decisions regarding market entry and go-to-market strategies. Specifically, they are interested in:

Market Overview: We provide a high-level overview of the Chicago bike-sharing market. This analysis instills confidence in Ziro by recommending a pilot test at the top 20 stations before committing to a full-scale operation. This strategy minimizes capital investment risks.

Pilot Test Strategy: We recommend the optimal time period for the pilot test and provide predictions for the total number of daily bike users in Chicago during this period.

Station-Level Analysis: Our project also focuses on in-depth analysis of the top 20 stations, helping Ziro predict the daily demand at one of these stations based on weather conditions.


Project Structure
Our project is organized into the following key phases:

Data Preprocessing: We clean and prepare the raw data for analysis, ensuring its quality and integrity.

Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization: We explore the dataset to gain insights, visualize trends, and identify patterns that will inform our recommendations.

Predictive Models: We employ advanced analytics and machine learning models to predict expected demand, aiding Ziro in resource allocation and operational planning.


Recommendations: We provide strategic recommendations based on our findings to guide Ziro's market entry and go-to-market strategies.
